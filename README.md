# Students-performance-prediction-using-ml
In today’s world technology has reached to the extent that it can be used to do various task in day-to-day life easily with less effort and time.
World today has realized the importance of education in one’s life which has led to revolution in the field of education. Universities, schools today have loads of tasks to be completed in a given timeline.
In today’s scenario schools need to analyze student performance manually which takes a lot of time and effort by faculties working on it. 
Hence in order to simplify this task a web-based system is introduced which can perform a student performance analysis system. 

This project aims to develop a student performance prediction system using machine learning techniques. 
The system will analyze various factors such as past academic records, study habits, extracurricular activities, and socio-economic background to forecast a student's potential performance in the 12th grade. 
By leveraging historical data and advanced algorithms, the system will provide valuable insights to educators and students, enabling early interventions and personalized support.
The project aspires to contribute to improved educational outcomes and student success by harnessing the power of data-driven predictions.
